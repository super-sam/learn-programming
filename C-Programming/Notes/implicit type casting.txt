IMPLICIT TYPE CASTING

In ARITHMETIC operator the lower size data type is converted to the higher type

In ASSIGNMENT operator the expression value is converted to the datatype holding the expression

float y;
int x;

y = x = 7.0/5;		y = 1; x = 1 (RIGHT TO LEFT)

x = y = 7.0/5;		x = 1; y = 1.4 (RIGHT TO LEFT, IMPLICIT CONVERSION OF ASSIGNMENT)

NOTE: 
1: THE C LANGUAGE DOESNT SPECIFY THE ORDER IN WHICH THE INCREMENT OR DECREMENT OPERATOR WILL BE EVALUATED
2: THE C LANGUAGE DOESNT SPECIFY THE ORDER IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION INSIDE PRINTF STATEMENT IS EXECUTED

THE PROPERTIES OF &&, || OPERATOR IN EXPRESSION: 

e1 and e2 are two expressions
e is the final expression

we Know that direction of resolving an expression is from Left to Right in case of && , || Operators

e = e1 && e2 
	First e1 will be resolved according to the property of && operator
	IF 
		e1 is false
	Then
		e2 will not be resolved and false will be stored in e

e = e1 || e2 
	First e1 will be resolved according to the property of ||operator
	IF 
		e1 is true
	Then
		e2 will not be resolved and True will be stored in e
